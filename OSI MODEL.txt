EXAMPLE1:
JANE MANAGES a chain of retail STORE
Each Store has its own local network for handling sales.
The store frequently facing problems
1.network issues die to which there is delay in processing sales and updating inventory

IT->how data travels across network

Solution:
OSI and TCP/IP MODELS->network->different layers
By analysing each layers, they identified that the problem waS WITH THE router configuration(Network Layer)

EXAMPLE 2:.
A large University Campus-Multiple buildings
Solution:
Transport Layer(where packet loss and retransmission were occurring because of outdated network switches



OSI MODEL
1.Application Layer
Applications create the data
AppliCation LAYER->end user
Browser 
2.Presentation Layer
Data is formatted and encrypted
3.Session Layer->
It established/manage the connection
4.Transport Layer
Data is divided into segments for reliable delivery
5.NetWork Layer
Segments->packets and routed
It tells the best path to transfer data from source to Destination.
6.Data Link Layer
Packets->framed and sent to the next device
7.Physical layer
Frames->bits and transmitted physically

Protocols:
1.HTTP/HTTPS(Secure)
Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
It is used for web browsing and secure web communication
2.FTP(File Transfer Protocol)
It is used to transfer files b/w computers
3.SMTP(Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)
Used for sending mails
4.DNS(Domain Name System)
It translates domain name into ip addresses
5.DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
It Dynamically assign ip addresses to devices on network
6.TCP(Transmission COntrol Protocol)
It ensures reliable, ordered and error checked delivery of data
7.UDP(User DataGram Protocol)
It provides faster but less reliable data transmission



DNS configuration on Linux:
1. Sudo apt-get install bind9
2.
