CN->Computer Network
Problem
John->small business->10 employees
He has all standalone computers in his office and in his office, employees uses pen drive to transfer data->security risk,
Data duplication.
John->employee-he lost the pen drive containing his client info.

Solution:
John decided to set up a LAN(Local Area Network) in his office.
By connecting all computers through a central switch and configuring a share drive,
So that employees could easily share files securely. Within network, john also setup a central printer

Problem2
GLobal Corp ->MNC Company->challange
It has several branches across different continents.
And faced challenges while transferring huge size of data
And also sometimes face network issue while video conferencing

Solution:
WAN(Wide Area Network)->connect all branches by using
Leased lines and configure VPN(Virtual Private Network)

What is Networking?
Networking is the practice of connecting multiple computers so that they can share information or any resource seamlessly

Importance?
1.it facilitates Communication and collaboration 
2.it enables resource sharing
3.it enhances data security and management
4.Improves productivity and efficiency

Network->interconnection of several computers,devices,resource

Different Types of network(based on Geographical Location)
1.LAN (Local Area Network)
A network that connects computer with a limited area such as 
Home , school or office
Implementation -> small business , schools

2.WAN(Wide Are Network)
A network that connects computers over a large geographical area (we use multiple lans to create WAN)
Implementation->MNC Companies

3.MAN(Metropolitan Area Network)
A Network that spans a city or a large campus
Implementations: City wide wifi, large university

4.PAN(Personal Area Network)
A Pan connects devices within a user’s area

Network Topologies(Based on Physical Connections):
Bus Topology
Advantages:
1.easy to install
2.requires less cable
3.cost effective

DisAdvantage:
1.not easy to maintain
2.limited cable length


Star Topology
1.easy to install and easy to manage
Disadvantage:
1.cost inefficiency 

Ring Topology
-data travels at high speed , no data collision
-a failure in any cable or device can disrupt network

Mesh Topology
-Reliable and scalable
-expensive,complex to install or manage

Setting up a Simple LAN Materials:
Network Switch
Ethernet cable
COmputer with NIC(Network Interface card)

Steps:
1.Connect the switch
2.Connect Computer with Switch
3.COnfigure Network Settings

Windows:
->Open control panel
->go to Network and sharing centre
->click on adapter settings 
->select IPV4 and click properties
->choose “Use the following IP Address”
